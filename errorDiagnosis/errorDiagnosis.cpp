 * \brief       This example shows how to read and understand the status registers of the TLE94112.
 * \details
 * It will run the motor in forward direction and then read the status registers every 5 seconds. 
 * It shows how to understand the status registers and which errors can appear.
 * Take this example if you want to learn how to debug the TLE94112 during operation.
