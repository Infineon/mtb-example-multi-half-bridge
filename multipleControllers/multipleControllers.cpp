 * \brief       This example shows how to use multiple TLE94112 controllers simultaneously.
 * \details
 * For this example it is assumed, that two TLE94112 controllers are connected to one microcontroller.
 * The resistor R7 on the board has to be open and R8 closed with 0Ohm for shield 1 and
 * R7 closed with 0Ohm, R8 open for shield 2. Also connect the chip select pin for the second board as set in
 * tle94112-platf-mtb.hpp.
 * On both controllers a load is connected between half bridge 1 and 5.
 * This example shows, how to control both motor controllers from one Raspberry Pi.
 *
 * \attention THIS EXAMPLE NEEDS TWO STACKED MULTI_HALF_BRIDGES WITH SEPERATE CHIPSELECT PINS
